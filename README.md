# hello-word
My First GitHub Project.

Uhh... I'm just a Korean student, and I wanna learn GitHub to improve my programming skills
Actually, I don't know even what is GitHub, and just know that the GitHub has a connection between text coding.
I've been doing block coding for several years, and I think it will be more better to do the text coding to make my skills better.
Ummm.... Alright, Thanks for reading my first works (tutorial, actually)
